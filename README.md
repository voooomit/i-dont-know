# i-dont-know
just stuff i work on that i find useless enough to share
this is a calculator, i was testing some stuff out and decided to make one
funny thing, i did have issues with the substract part, python for some weird reason has it spelled out as subsctract, i spent like 20 minutes trying to figure 
that out, really stupid but funny at the same time
